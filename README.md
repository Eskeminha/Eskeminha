### About Me
👋Greetings! I'm Anderson Koefender, also known as Eskeminha.

🏠 Currently calling Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, home sweet home. ![brazil](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stevenrskelton/flag-icon/master/png/16/country-4x3/br.png)

My background? Started coding as a hobby in 2004 during my Computer Engineering days at UNISINOS, but ended up in Law School. Now, I'm running my own law office while diving deep into Computer Science at UNISINOS. 💼💻

Let's talk passions: Computers, tech, video games, coding, cars, and music? Yeah, they've been my ride-or-die crew forever. From geeking out over circuits to conquering virtual worlds, I've been all in. But hey, I'm not just a tech-head. I'm also a fierce advocate for justice, whether in the courtroom or behind a screen. Oh, and did I mention my love for cars and music? 🚗🎵

And hey, let's not forget the fun stuff: DJing, music production, and even a little bit of car racing thrown in for good measure. 🎧🏎️

Ready to blend my passions and skills to code a brighter, fairer future! 💥💻✨
